To help them achieve this goal, I used the API provided by their video publishing platform and integrated it with their WordPress site.

The FWMag team needed a way to create, edit, and serve static files more efficiently than going through many different admin pages and very limiting custom content fields, so I created platform for them.<br /><br /> Javascript, HTML, images, videos, and CSS, can be uploaded to this platform over SFTP or a front end ui. The front end displays a table that lists the uploaded files by the page or category they will be served on the FWMag site, each link when clicked gives the option to copy a direct url or an HTML tag version.<br /><br /> The team can now easily work with HTML, CSS, and Javascript using git for version control and SFTP to deploy so long as they include the link on the page or template they create in Metro Publisher.",

The scope of the project was massive and one of my biggest challenges.<br /><br /> The client wanted their own LinkedIn type social network with added in project management, forums, news, company wide calendars and contact directory, JIRA integration, and even a fully bespoke animated weather widget. To pose another challenge they required this all to be done with WordPress and Visual Composer based theme with a selection of must have plugins.<br /><br /> I tied everything together in the backend with an event driven interface that links everything properly in the DB and made wrappers around all of the different plugin and service APIs to make it easy for everything to work together. I created a notification and activity system that largely extended what the BuddyPress plugin provided, to the rest of the features of the site. I adapted SQL queries they provided to a JIRA ticket display table I built with Vue.js. I created a unified permission and profile system that ties in all of the employee profiles, content, and events related to them. I wrote a completely custom weather widget with css animations for all weather conditions. Finally all content and design they wanted to be editable, I integrated with Visual Composer."
